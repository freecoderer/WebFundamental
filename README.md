Hi again! this time, I will be going to discuss Meta's certification introduction course on Coursera which is called **Introduction to Front-End Development.**

Here are the key points about the course syllabus. There are four kinds of modules which are consisting of this program. Module 1: Get started with web development. Module 2: Introduction to HTML5 and CSS. Module 3: UI Frameworks Module 4: Graded Assessment. by ending this course, you can do these kinds of things.

·       Describe the front-end developer role

·       Explain the core and underlying technologies that power the internet

·       Use HTML to create a simple webpage

·       Use CSS to control the appearance of a simple webpage

·       Explain what React is

·       Describe the applications and characteristics of the most popular UI frameworks

I think it is impressive that they are conducting a little bit of Bootstrap and React on this course, which makes me help to get an insight into the full view of frontend development.

Let's start with **Module 1**

**Module 1: Get started with web development**

* ### **Describe the web developer job role and Distinguish between front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.**
    

In this module, I've learned what is the main role of the **Web Developer**. The role of the **Web Developer** simply consists of **Front-end**, **Back-end**, and **Full Stack**. A **Front-end** developer is someone that works all parts of a website or web app that the user will interact with. This can be anything from the style colors, buttons, menus, or user interactions as they click swipe, and interact with the site. The skills **Front-end** users can use are consists of three different languages **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** and these are the main three stacks that they are using nowadays. While **HTML** and **CSS** skills are essential, the most critical skill is usually **Javascript**. It is the core of **Front-end** technology, this is mainly because of its versatility and the fact that it is paired with powerful libraries and frameworks such as **react**.

A **Back-end** developer works on the parts of a website or web app that the end users don't see these activities, which is particularly on the web server in the database or in constructing the architecture. **Back-end** developers are responsible for creating and maintaining functionality when users request information or when the website needs to communicate with another part of the web architecture.

A **Full-stack** developer is someone equally comfortable working with **Front-end** and **Back-end** technologies. **Full-stack** developers have skills and knowledge in all areas o the web development project.

With this knowledge, I've learned what is the role of a frontend developer and what are their exact roles, which gives me a correct insight into web development.

* ### **Explain how data moves through the internet and Describe the technologies that underpin the internet.**
    

When we open the browser, and that moment, we instantly connect to the world wide web, because we are connected to a **network**. but it becomes complicated because each device needs to connect to every other device to communicate effectively. It can be solved by a **network switch** that connects multiple devices and allows them to communicate with each other. The **network switch** then connects with other **network switches**. This **network switch** then connects to more **network switches** until connects with something called an interconnected network, which is called the **Internet.**

When we use websites or video streaming services on the Internet, these are provided by computers called **servers**. The devices that we use are called **clients**, and these relationships are called a **client-server model**.

And as I said before, a **server** is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to instant messaging. It's called a **server** because it provides a service to another computer and its use is also known as the **client**. Which is typically stored in something called a data center with hundreds or thousands of other **servers**, all running different services connected to the internet. There are many different systems in data centers to ensure that servers have continuous power, and a continuous internet connection and are kept called 24 hours per day.

Many **websites** use these to allow you to access your content quickly from the data center nearest to you. The **data center servers** are built based on the service purpose. For example, if the **server** is only to be used for storing images, it might have a lot of hard drive space.

Whereas server computing complex calculations might need a fast processor and a lot of memory. This is usually referred to as **server hardware**. The physical components of a **server**. Once the **server hardware** is installed in the data center, a piece of code can now run. The code that runs on the **hardware** is commonly known as **software**.

* ### **Explain the difference between websites and webpages**
    

A **Web page** is a document that displays images, texts, video, and other content in the web browser, a **Website** is a **collection of webpages** that are linked together. In its most basic form, a **webpage** is just a text document, If a developer wants to work with a **webpage**, he or she needs to know about three technologies and need an understanding of how they interact, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

**HTML** structures the content you see, **CSS** controls the colors and style and **JavaScript** is responsible for user interaction.

**HTML** stands for hypertext markup language, it works by using something called **markup tags**. **CSS** is short for cascading style sheets and adds visual enhancements like colors and layout to the web page, this is commonly known as styling. It enhances the **HTML** elements and tells them how to display them. And lastly, **JavaScript**, which is a programming language built into the browser. **JavaScript** provides web developers with tools for interactivity, data processing, control, and action.

Let's get into how exactly does the code build with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** is translated to display the content When a copy of that webpage is sent from the **web server** to your browser, each line of code is processed in sequential order from first to last. As each line is interpreted, the browser creates the **building blocks**, which is the visual representation you see on the screen. This creation process is known as **page rendering**, the response from the web server must be a complete web page to fulfill the request, to show the page in the browser.

* ### **What is the web browser?**
    

A **web browser** is a software application that you use to browse the **World Wide Web**. It works by sending a request to a **web server** and then receiving a response containing the content that is to be displayed on the screen of your device. Once the browser is open on your device, there is the address bar where you input the address of the website that you want to visit. The address is commonly known as the **Uniform Resource Locator** or **URL** for short. When you make a request using this **URL**, the browser and server communicate using a protocol known as the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** or **HTTP**. Once the web browser receives the content, it displays it on the screen of your device. This exchange of information is made possible by something known as the **request-response cycle**.

* ### **Web Hosting**
    

**Web hosting** is a service where someone can place that person's website and files on the hosting company's web server. A person doesn't need to be accompanied to use a **web host**, and that person can rent space too.

There are many different **web hosting** methods such as **shared hosting**, **virtual private hosting**, **dedicated hosting**, and **Cloud hosting**.

The cheapest form of web hosting is known as **shared hosting** which means If someone wants to run a **web server**, they must pay for a location on a **web server** that contains many **web hosting accounts**, which means that person needs to share the service processing power, memory, and bandwidth with other which can be led to slow the performance of the web server.

For the bigger sites, the developer needs to consider a **virtual private surface** or **VPS**. A **VPS** is a virtual server with dedicated **CPU**, **memory**, and **bandwidth** resources. Which will be running on a hardware server with other **VPS** instances but as the resources are fixed per **VPS** instance.

And we have dedicated hosting which will be dedicated to only me including All hardware, CPU, memory, and bandwidth resource to only one person.

Last we have **Cloud Computing**. With **Cloud hosting**, the website is run in something called a **Cloud environment**, which spans across multiple physical and virtual servers. If a physical or virtual server fails, a website will run on a different server and stay online. One of the main advantages of Cloud hosting is that individuals can use them without hardware limitations and also that can be paid based on use.

* ### **Internet Protocols**
    

**IP Address**: For easy to think, they function like addresses in a postal system that makes it possible for packets of information to be delivered.

**Internet Protocol**: There are two versions of **internet protocol**, version four and version six are the two most widely used standards of **internet protocol** the first one is version four which contains four octets separated by periods or dots. For example 192.23.14.15. and version six contains eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by a colon, For example4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329.

**IP packet:** When someone sends data across the network, the data that is sent is called an **IP packet** which is also called a datagram an **IP packet** contains a header and a payload of the data. A header itself has a destination IP address and source IP address. And the payload itself contains data from the packet and some of the other protocols which will cover in a moment backup for a problem issue, the payload contains a protocol just in case of an error.

**TCP**: **Transmission Control Protocol** referred to as TCP TCP has the ability that a message or a packet can go right away but it has more delay rather than using UDP.

**UDP: User Datagram Protocol** referred to as UDP has better speed and shorter delay than TCP, but it doesn't guarantee that data can go right away.

* ### **HTTP**
    

**HTTP:** HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used for transferring web resources such as HTML documents, images, styles, and other files. HTTP is a request-based protocol there are some commonly used HTTP methods which are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE**

**GET**: This is used to retrieve information from the given server.

**POST**: Send data to the server.

**PUT**: Updates whatever currently exists on the website.

**DELETE**: Remove the resources

**HTTP status code:**

**100-199**: Informational (Provisional responses) **100**: Continue (web client should continue to request or ignore the response if the request is already finished)

**200-299**: Successful responses **200**: OK which means vary bu the HTTP methods Case GET: resource is found and is included in the body of HTTP response. POST & PUT: the resource was successfully transmitted to the web server. DELETE: the resource was deleted

**300-399**: Redirection messages: Indicate to the web client that the requested resource has been moved to a different path. **301**: Moved Permanently **302**: Found (Which is temporary redirection)

**400-499**: Client error: **400** is used where the web browser or client submitted bad data to the web server. **401** is used to indicate that the user must log into an account before the request can be processed. **403** is used to indicate the request was valid, but that the webserver is refusing to process it. This is often used to indicate that a user does not have sufficient permissions to execute an action in a web application. **404** is used to indicate that the requested resource was not found on the web server.

**500-599**: Server error indicates that a failure occurred on the webserver while trying to process the request. **500**: Internal Server Error, which is a generic error status indicating that the server fails to process the request.

**HTTPS:** This is the secure version of HTTP, which is used for secure communication between two computers so that nobody else can see the information being sent and received which can be managed by **encryption**. **HTTPS** acts the same way as HTTP but the difference is before the content is sent, It is turning into a secret code.

* ### **Difference Between Frameworks and Libraries**
    

**Libraries**: Reusable pieces of code that can be used by someone's application. They are purpose-built to provide specific functionality. Developer uses the library to access the functionality they require so that they can have more advantage in building their apps.

**Frameworks**: Provide a structure for developers to build with.

***Frameworks are considered opinionated and libraries are considered unopinionated.***

* ### **API**
    

An **API**(application programming interface) is a set of functions and procedures for creating applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application or another service Some common API's that web developers work with include Browser API, **REST API**

API's are often the bridge between different components or systems. This earns them names like gateway or middleware. The term is used widely to represent many different tools and systems.

**Browser or Web API**: they are usually built into the browser itself. They extend the functionality of the browser by adding new services and are designed to simplify complex functions and provide easy syntax for building advanced features.

**DOM API**: The **DOM API** turns the HTML document into a tree of nodes that are represented as JavaScript objects.

**RESTful** or **REST API**: This kind of API provides data for popular web and mobile apps. These are also called web servers.

REST(Representational State Transfer): This is a set of principles that help build highly efficient API. One of the main responsibilities of these kinds of API's is sending and receiving data to and from a centralized database.

RESTful API: Web server responds to requests. this means that RESTful API must be able to accomplish things like getting data or get, creating data. Also referred to as post updating data or put and deleting data or delete. API issues, REST principles and good design practices to create discoverable interfaces. This helps get the exact response expected.

* ### **How Restful Works**
    

These API's use endpoints to specify how different resources can be accessed. The endpoint is built into the URL when accessing the API. Once the endpoint is hit, the API performs whatever service-side processing is needed to build the response. Two common forms of response are full web page is a data form based on JavaScript called Jason and XML

* ### **IDE**
    

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, We will use VScode when we try to manage our Development environment.

And That's It!!! Pretty Long right? I think It will be the longest article beause it is introduction article. The Module one is consisted of how the web works and what are the main baselines that structure web. These are not technical ones but I think they are super important to learn how the web works and they will be your backbone to understanding how the web will work, I hope you like this article and see you on Module 2 Review! :)
